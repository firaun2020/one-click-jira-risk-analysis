# Risk-AI for Jira (Forge App)

**Risk-AI** is a Forge-powered Jira app that automates risk assessments for technical Change Requests using OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo model. It reads issue data and generates structured risk insights directly into a custom field.

---

## ‚ú¶ Features

- One-click AI-based risk analysis from within Jira issues
- Automatically writes output into a custom field
- Prevents re-analysis if an entry already exists
- Designed for structured, professional output that non-technical stakeholders can read

---

## How It Works
- App fetches summary, description, and Risk-Analysis field.
- If the field is already populated, it aborts.
- If not, it sends data to GPT-4-turbo with a structured prompt.
- AI returns 3‚Äì6 risk bullet points.
- Output is written in ADF format to Jira, including a timestamp like:

```bash
Generated on: 27-June-2025, 15:00
```
